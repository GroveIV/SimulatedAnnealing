# SimulatedAnnealing

An attempt at using simulated annealing in order to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem.  
The code is fairly acccurate for any number of cities below about 150 but quickly becomes
less and less approximate to the optimum solution as well as very slow.  Any number of cities
above 200 starts to take a long time to run the program, change the temperature and alpha 
variables in order for the program to come up with a solution more quickly (but possibly less
approximate).
